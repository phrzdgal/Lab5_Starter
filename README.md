## Question 1:
No I wouldn't. The full "message" feature would contain many components, and ideally the unit tests are made to test indivdual components and their operations separately rather than an entire component with interworking parts.

## Question 2: 
Yes. Going off of the previous answer, because the maximum word or character length feature of a text or chat is one single component, it is much easier to work with and test with when it comes to producing a unit test. There are very few if any interworking parts, which makes a unit test use here ideal.
